Hello.

Assistant (2):
Hello, I am a dtSearch assistant. What can I help you with?

--------------------------------------------------

User (3):
I am looking for all documents with the name, Andrew Cornsworth. I need different variations of the spelling of the last name. Both names need to exist. Within that search, I need all documents with the name Susan Lardner. Both searches need a date restriction between June 1, 2023 and July 30, 2924.

--------------------------------------------------

Assistant (4):
Thanks — I can build dtSearch queries for this. Quick question before I give specific strings: did you mean the date range end year 2024 (July 30, 2024) or 2924? I’ll assume 2024 below but confirm if 2924 was intentional.

Below are ready-to-copy dtSearch-style queries and explanations of different strategies (so you can pick stricter or broader matches). I assume you want two searches (one for Andrew Cornsworth with variant spellings of the last name; one for Susan Lardner), and I also show how to get documents containing both names.

Important: dtSearch GUI also has a date filter panel; it’s safest to set the date range there (see instructions after the queries).

1) Basic / strict searches
- Andrew with last-name variants (require both names in same document; allow a middle initial between first and last):
  Andrew w/2 (Cornsworth OR Cornswarth OR Cornsorth OR Cornsword OR Cornswrth)

- Susan Lardner (allow possible middle initial):
  Susan w/2 (Lardner OR Lardnor OR Lardener OR Lardn*)

Notes:
- w/2 lets one intervening token (e.g., “Andrew L. Cornsworth”).
- I listed several plausible last-name spellings in the OR list; add or remove variants you know.

2) Wildcard-based, broader search (catches many suffix variants)
- Andrew w/2 Cornsw*
- Susan w/2 Lardn*

Use these when you want a broad capture of many different suffix/misspelling patterns. Cornsw* will match Cornsworth, Cornswarth, Cornsword, etc. Lardn* will match Lardner, Lardnor, etc.

3) Exact phrase search (stricter — first and last adjacent and exact)
- "Andrew Cornsworth"
- "Susan Lardner"

Use quotes when you only want the exact adjacent name with no middle initial.

4) Fuzzy / phonetic strategies (catch more misspellings or OCR errors)
- Use dtSearch’s fuzzy or phonetic/index options (in Index/Search options). Two practical approaches:
  - Add more OR variants explicitly (most precise control).
  - Enable fuzzy matching or phonetic indexing in dtSearch (in Index Options, turn on fuzzy/whole-word options); then use a wildcard term like Cornsw* or a single token Cornsworth and let the fuzzy engine match close spellings.

Note: exact fuzzy syntax can vary by version; if you want, tell me which dtSearch version you use and I’ll give the exact fuzzy operator form.

5) Combined search (documents containing both people)
If you need documents that contain both Andrew (with last-name variants) and Susan Lardner, use AND:
(Andrew w/2 (Cornsworth OR Cornswarth OR Cornsorth OR Cornsword OR Cornswrth)) AND (Susan w/2 (Lardner OR Lardnor OR Lardener OR Lardn*))

6) Date restriction
Best practice: apply the date range using dtSearch’s Date/Size/Custom Metadata filter so the index filters by document created/modified date. Steps (dtSearch Desktop / Web UI — terminology may differ by version):
- In the Search window click Search Options (or Options).
- Find the Date/Size (or Date range) panel.
- Choose which date field to filter on (e.g., Modified date, Created date, or a metadata field).
- Set From = 06/01/2023 and To = 07/30/2024 (confirm end year).
- Run the text query above along with that date filter.

If you prefer to include a date condition in the text query itself, dtSearch sometimes supports date-field queries (depends on your index fields). If you tell me which date field you use (Modified, Created, or a custom metadata field), I can craft the exact date-filter expression for your dtSearch version.

7) Additional suggestions / tips
- If you get too many false positives with a wildcard, tighten the query by listing explicit variants with OR.
- If OCR’d documents produce many misspellings, use fuzzy/phonetic indexing or increase OCR quality before indexing.
- If you only care about documents where the two names appear near each other (e.g., same paragraph), use a proximity between the names: (Andrew w/2 Cornsw*) AND (Susan w/20 Lardn*) — replace 20 with the maximum number of words you want allowed between the names.

If you confirm:
- whether the end year should be 2024,
- whether you want separate searches or the intersection (both people in same doc),
- which date field to filter on (Created, Modified, or custom),

I’ll give final polished queries (and exact fuzzy syntax if you tell me your dtSearch version).
