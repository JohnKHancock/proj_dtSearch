Hello, I am building an LLM based application that converts natural language query into a dtSearch search syntax query.
Right now, the app is in the file setup.ipynb. In the current state, the app makes a call to OpenAI's gpt-4.1-mini model.
The function "convert_to_dtSearch(query:str)" takes in a natural language query and converts it into a dtSearch query. 
My first request is to take the code in the python notebook and convert it into a class called "nlp_dtsearch.py".
Please show me recommendations on the optimal way to convert the code in the notebook to a class and provide explanations.

The program looks great so far. I have updated the DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT to constrain the responses to only recreating
queries from Natural Language to dtSearch. Do you have any suggestions to contrain responses to user prompts?

We've done some testing, and the feedback is that the app should be more friendly and offer more suggestions. 
The answers are a little too concise. Also, we want the app to list multiple suggestions. For example, a user 
needs to search for all instances of the word, Amoxicillin. They need fuzzy searches, root word, wildcard, phonetic, etc.
What do you recommend to make the app offer more robust answers and provide a list of possible searches?

We need the app to retain the conversational history. We want the user to ask follow up questions on the responses. 
What do you suggest?

Great. We now need to build User Interface for the app using gradio. When the UI loads, the title should be NLP to dtSearch. 
There should be three panels, a side panel which will be added later, a middle panel where a user can input the search request and
engage in a conversation in an input box. The responses will be under the box. On the third panel, the UI would show the history of the conversation. 
Is this something that can be done? 


Okay. Let's make the following changes:
1. Give the user the ability to download chat history into a text file. 
2. Change the theme of the app to dark.
3. Change the color of the buttons to orange
4. Make the left panel collapseable
5. Change the font type to Arial
6. Create a button that clears chat history
